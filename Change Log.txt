Version 0.92
- Added support for separate read and write LEDs or multi-colored LEDs.
Version 0.91
- Fix a bug in the boot disk handling on reset.
- Renamed the LCD text "Boot Disk On" to "AutoMnt Boot On" and "Boot Disk Off" to "AutoMnt Boot Off". This matches what the ADE is actually doing when the Drive Select key is held for a long key press. It doesn't unmount the boot.dsk, it enables and disables the auto mount on a reset.
- Added in detection for consecutive soft resets, they will be treated as a hard resets.
Version 0.90
- In addition to this release, I have also released the initial version of ADE Commander. More information at: https://git.io/JUy69
- Needed to change the file type number assignments for the root, back directory and directory. Using 0 didn't make sense.
- Fixed a bug in the file type encoding. It was not sending as a byte, but rather as ASCII.
- Small bug fixes in the SD command handling.
- Fixed a bug in how the ADE set the drive status. 
- Added SD Command 0xF5 - Save ADE Config
- Added SD Command 0xF6 - Delete File or Directory
- Added SD Command 0xF7 - Create Image File or Directory
- Added SD Command 0xF8 - Rename Image File or Directory
- Added SD Command 0xF9 - Cut, Copy and Paste Image File
Version 0.82
- Re-wrote the key press handling function. This adds in better de-bouncing and less lag time.
- Changed the ADAMnet send timings. This will allow the ADE to work with a wider range of Mega clones.
Version 0.80
- Added SD card directory support.
- The right button (mount/unmount) action has changed. A short press will mount files and change directories. A long press will unmount the currently selected drive.
- A long press on the drive select button will turn the boot disk on and off.
- A short press on the left button will now go back one directory. A long press will go back to the root.
- Added ColecoVision cartridge ROM support (Maximum 32k). Files needs to have a COL, BIN or ROM extension. Mounting a ROM file dynamically creates a disk image containing the required boot code and the ROM data. Nothing is saved to the SD card. In testing this feature there are a small number of ROM's that do not work.
- Added a "Debug Mode" option to the Device Setup menu. When enabled this will display debug information on the LCD.
- SD Command 0xF2 (Return Currently Mounted Disk) will now include the directory. 
- SD Command 0xF3 (Mount/Unmount Disk) will return the file type in the block. This will enable the controlling Adam program to see the file type being mounted.
- SD Command 0xFA (Format Disk) now requires a confirmation step to start the format. The confirmation needs to be the next read in order to work.
- Added additional information to the block that is transmitted when the 0xDEADBEEF block read is sent. Including LCD name length, number of files in the current directory and the current directory string.
- Changed the 0xFACE format command. It is much faster now.
- Added support for a disk swap button. The disk swap only works on Device 4. Holding down the swap button on startup will either disable Device 5 if it is currently enabled, or enabled all of the devices if Device 5 is currently disabled. 
- Added a check for the maximum number of files per directory. A warning will be sent to the serial port and the LCD.
- Fixed the hard reset detection timing while using the IDE Boot rom. If this is still an issue, using the Debug Mode can help to determine the correct timings.
- Fixed SD Command issues mounting D3.
- Fixed the LCD Name Length bug. This can now be set to any number 99 or less. Using 12 or under will enable dos 8.3 file names. 
- Fixed the issue with programs sending continuous unknown commands and locking up the LCD.  The ADE will still show that it received an unknown command, but this will not lock up the display.

Version 0.73
- Fixed the timing issue with some games causing corruption due to a double write.
- Re-implemented the "Disable Next Reset" option.
Version 0.7
- Moved the time critical AdamNet send and receive functions to the CommandInterrupt function. This ensures that data is being sent to the Adam with the correct timing and not being delayed due to LCD writes or button processing. This fixes the I/O errors in some titles and also prevents errors from buttons being pressed while blocks are loading. This is a major re-write of how the ADE interacts on the AdamNet.
- Added the ability to detect the type of reset. A "hard" reset is from physically activating the reset switch on the Adam or turning it off and on. A "soft" reset is initiated by the Adam software. Only a "hard" reset will cause the book.dsk to be re-mounted. This fixes the issue with some games calling a software reset during loading.
- Removed the "Disable Next Reset" option from the SD Command "0xF3 - Mount/Unmount Disk". This is no longer required now that the ADE can detect the type of reset.
- The filename for the boot disk is no longer case sensitive. "Boot.DSK" will work even if the file is really called "boot.dsk"
- Added status information to the block that is transmitted when the DEADBEEF block read is sent. See the SD Commands text file for the format. The basic program INIT on the ADE Test disk image will demonstrate this read.
- Re-wrote most of the LCD scroll and LCD refresh functions. They are more efficient now.
- In the SD command 0xF4, added the ability to initiate an LCD refresh with the high word only. This will prevent any Adam Image manager from initiating a write to an actual Adam disk drive.

Version 0.6
- Fixed bug in entering config mode. If using the digital buttons, ADE would sometimes go into config mode with no button pressed.
- Added separate button delay timing for analog buttons and digital buttons.
- Added a variable to set the sensitivity of the analog read.

Version 0.5
- Changed how the AdamNet line is connected; it now requires a PNP transistor and 2 resistors. This version is not compatible with the old method of connecting the AdamNet line to the Mega2560. This was required to improve the reliability of the AdamNet communication.
- Added the device configuration mode. Enables any drive to be turned on or off.
- Added a voltage monitor mode.
- Add extra step to send SD commands and access large disk images. This will enhance Adam program compatibility, while maintaining the ability to use SD commands and very large disk images.
- Fixed a write bug. ADE was not sending the required ACK after receiving the block data to write.
- Fixed a timing bug in Process Command. ADE was sending the ACK back to the Adam too fast, it was sometimes missed.
- Fixed the status not being reset after the status was sent. This caused issues with programs that tried to access blocks outside of the normal range on purpose. (ie Formatter 3)

Version 0.4
- Added large disk image support.
- Added flag to disable the FACE command. This ties in with the large disk image support.
- Added SD card commands. Adam can access the directory and mount images.
- Added a delay to enable exact timing of an original disk drive. Default is 0.
- Added the connection to the AdamNet reset line. This will enable a boot disk to be auto-mounted on an Adam reset.
- Added the ability to assign a boot disk.
- Added the ability to use digital buttons.

Version 0.3

- Bug fixes for AdamCalc
- Added individual 1k buffers for each drive.
- Added error when SD card is not inserted.
- Increased the maximum files to 300
- Added support of DDP files.

Version 0.2
- The right key now will mount and unmount the currently selected file to the selected drive.
- The mounted files are saved to the eeprom. On power up they are re-mounted in the last position.
- The big change is multi-drive support. There is a variable that can be changed when you upload the code to your Arduino (NumberofDrives). - This is located at the beginning of the main file. ADE will now emulate up to 4 drives at one time.
